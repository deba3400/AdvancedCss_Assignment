In CSS, the `var()` function is used for defining and using custom properties (also known as CSS variables). Here's a breakdown of its purpose and functionality:

1. **Defining Custom Properties:**
   You can define your own custom properties using the `--` prefix followed by a name and assign a value to it. For example:
   ```css
   :root {
     --main-color: blue;
   }
   ```
   Here, `--main-color` is a custom property with the value `blue` defined within the `:root` pseudo-class (which represents the root element of the document, typically the `<html>` element).

2. **Using Custom Properties with `var()`:**
   After defining a custom property, you can use its value elsewhere in your CSS using the `var()` function. For instance:
   ```css
   p {
     color: var(--main-color);
   }
   ```
   In this example, the `color` property of `<p>` elements will be set to the value of `--main-color`, which is `blue`.

3. **Dynamic Value Assignment:**
   CSS variables offer a way to dynamically update styles by changing the value of a custom property at runtime. For instance, you can update `--main-color` using JavaScript, and all elements referencing `var(--main-color)` will reflect the new value automatically.

4. **Fallback Values:**
   The `var()` function can take a second argument, which serves as a fallback value if the custom property is not defined. For example:
   ```css
   p {
     color: var(--main-color, black);
   }
   ```
   Here, if `--main-color` is not defined, the text color of `<p>` elements will default to `black`.

5. **Reuse and Maintainability:**
   CSS variables allow you to define reusable values throughout your stylesheet, promoting maintainability and consistency. They also make it easier to update styles globally by modifying a few custom property values.

In summary, the `var()` function in CSS is essential for working with custom properties (CSS variables), providing a way to define, use, and manage reusable values in your stylesheets efficiently.
